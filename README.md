# DeepReader


## **What is DeepReader?**

DeepReader, initially created as a CSCI2963 project, is an application that increases comprehension of textbooks by requiring the user to take notes as they read, and then checking the quality of the notes. DeepReader is implemented mainly in C++, using QtWidgets and Poppler.


## **How do I run DeepReader?**

Download [Qt Creator version 4.5](https://www.qt.io/download/) and [Poppler Qt5](https://people.freedesktop.org/~aacid/docs/qt5/). From there open all files in the DeepReader folder and hit the run button. A executable that's easier to run is coming soon within the next month!


## **How can you contribute?**

If you're looking to get involved with DeepReader first take a look at open issues. If there are any open issues you are welcome to contribute! In addition if you're planning on contributing join our channel on slack. We have a slack channel for DeepReader at RCOS.slack.com, please email madisonawheeler@gmail.com or contact any other contributors to be added to the slack. If no issues are open feel free to contribute in smaller ways such as fixing spelling errors or adding documentation. You could also fork your own version of DeepReader to add anything you'd like, if there are any features you think should be added or any issues you see we encourage you to post them in the slack.
